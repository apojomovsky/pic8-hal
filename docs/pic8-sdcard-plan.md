# `pic8-sdcard`: SD/MMC-over-SPI block storage for PIC18F2455/2550/4455/4550 — implementation plan

Status: **proposed, not started**. Written for a fresh implementing agent
with no other context on this conversation — read this top to bottom
before writing code. Follows the same vendor-a-third-party-stack shape as
`pic8-usb` (`docs/pic8-usb-plan.md`) — read that plan first if unfamiliar
with this repo's M-Stack vendoring conventions; this plan assumes it.

## What this is

A block-storage driver for SD/MMC cards over SPI, wrapping M-Stack's
`storage/mmc.c` (SD/MMC-over-SPI, 512-byte block read/write,
SDSC/SDHC/SDXC detection, multi-block writes) and `storage/crc.c` (the
CRC7/CRC16 checksums the SD SPI protocol requires), the same vendored
upstream this repo already pulled in for `pic8-usb`
(`github.com/signal11/m-stack`, commit
`979665546f3f39fb4b28a4acedfb1f9a5c55782e`). Unlike the USB stack, this
half of M-Stack has **no chip-specific code at all** — it talks to the SD
card entirely through a small set of caller-supplied SPI/CS/timer
callbacks, so there is no `usb_hal.h`-style peripheral port to write.

## Chip scope: PIC18F2455/2550/4455/4550 only — but for a different reason than pic8-usb

Read this before assuming the SPI (SSP) HAL driver being genuinely
portable means the module is too.

`pic18fxx5x-hal` and `pic16f87xa-hal` **both** have a working SSP driver
with the same neutral API (`HAL_SSP_Init`, `HAL_SSP_WriteByte`,
`HAL_SSP_ReadByte`, ...) — confirmed by reading both headers;
`pic18fxx5x_ssp.h`'s own doc comment says it "mirrors pic16f87xa_ssp.h ...
so consumer code is portable." Unlike `pic8-usb`, there is no hardware
reason this module couldn't link against either family.

**The real blocker is RAM, not the peripheral.** `mmc.h` fixes
`MMC_BLOCK_SIZE` at 512 bytes — a hard constant, "the only size supported
by this implementation," not a tunable knob, because that's what the SD
protocol's block size is. Every `pic16f87xa-hal` family member's *total*
RAM is smaller than one block: `PIC16F87XA_FAMILY_RAM_BYTES` is 192 for
PIC16F873A/874A and 368 for PIC16F876A/877A (confirmed in
`pic16f87xa-hal/include/pic16f87xa.h`) — even the family's largest part
falls 144 bytes short of holding a single SD block buffer, before
accounting for the `mmc_card` struct, CRC state, the call stack, or
anything the caller's own firmware needs. PIC18F4550 has 2048 bytes and
comfortably clears it (confirmed for real: `pic8-usb`'s wrapper alone used
454 bytes per the actual `xc8-cc` build in that plan's Phase 2 findings,
leaving room for a 512-byte buffer alongside it, though combining both in
one firmware image is worth re-checking for real once it's built rather
than assumed — see "Open risks" below).

So: build the SPI/GPIO/timer binding layer in a way that's honestly
portable C (no reason to hand-tie it to PIC18 SFRs directly, when the HAL
already isn't family-specific here) — but scope the module's *target* list
to PIC18F2455/2550/4455/4550, same as `pic8-usb`, because that's the only
family where the fixed 512-byte block size actually fits. If this repo
ever gains a PIC18 or PIC16 family member with less RAM, or M-Stack's
block size assumption changes upstream, revisit; not true today.

## Third-party dependency: same M-Stack commit, a separate small vendored copy

Extract just `storage/include/{crc.h,mmc.h}` and `storage/src/{crc.c,mmc.c}`
(roughly 1,200 lines total, vs. the full USB stack) from the same pinned
upstream commit already vendored for `pic8-usb`
(`979665546f3f39fb4b28a4acedfb1f9a5c55782e`) into
`pic8-sdcard/third_party/m-stack-storage/`. **Do not** make `pic8-sdcard`
depend on `pic8-usb/third_party/m-stack/` directly — this module has zero
USB dependency, and reaching into a sibling module's `third_party/` would
be a real coupling for no reason; a second small vendored copy, pinned the
same way, is the right amount of duplication (mirrors why `pic8-common` is
the shared-code answer for *this repo's own* code, not for third-party
vendoring). Same Apache-2.0 arm of the LGPLv3/Apache-2.0 dual license, same
`VENDORED_COMMIT`-file convention as `pic8-usb/third_party/m-stack/`.

Confirm both files still compile standalone (no `usb.h`/`usb_config.h`
dependency leaked in from being physically colocated with the USB stack
upstream) as the first implementation step — they read as self-contained
from `mmc.h`'s own doc comment ("A driver for the SPI hardware itself is
not provided here... client software... provide[s]... `mmc_config.h`"),
but confirm before building on top.

## Confirmed API surface (read directly from the vendored headers)

- `crc.h`: `add_crc7(csum, input)`, `add_crc16(csum, input)`,
  `add_crc16_array(csum, data, len)` — pure math, no callbacks, no state
  beyond the running checksum the caller threads through.
- `mmc.h`: `mmc_init(card_array, count)`, `mmc_init_card(card)`,
  `mmc_get_num_blocks(card)`, `mmc_ready(card)`, `mmc_is_initialized(card)`,
  `mmc_set_uninitialized(card)`, `mmc_read_block(card, block_addr, data)`,
  `mmc_write_block(card, block_addr, data)`, and a multi-block write
  triplet (`mmc_multiblock_write_start/data/end`, plus `_cancel`). `data`
  buffers are always exactly `MMC_BLOCK_SIZE` (512) bytes.
- Required callback macros, bound in a caller-supplied `mmc_config.h`
  (M-Stack's compile-time binding convention, same as `usb_config.h` for
  the USB stack): `MMC_SPI_TRANSFER(instance, out_buf, in_buf, len)`
  (blocking full-duplex SPI transfer), `MMC_SPI_SET_CS(instance, value)`
  (0=asserted), `MMC_SPI_SET_SPEED(instance, speed_hz)` (set SPI clock
  ≤ the requested rate). `mmc.c` calls `MMC_SPI_SET_SPEED` with a slow rate
  during card bring-up (SD spec requires ≤ 400 kHz until the card leaves
  idle state) and with `max_speed_hz` afterward — this module's binding
  needs to actually change the SSP clock divisor at runtime, not just
  accept and ignore the call.
- Optional `MMC_USE_TIMER` + `MMC_TIMER_START/EXPIRED/STOP(instance, ...)`:
  if undefined, `MMC_TIMER_EXPIRED` becomes a hardcoded `false` and
  `mmc.c` falls back to bounded retry counts (e.g.
  `NUM_ACMD41_RETRIES 32768`) with no real wall-clock timeout. **This
  module should define `MMC_USE_TIMER`** and bind the three macros to
  `pic8-tick` (same dependency `pic8-debounce` already takes for real
  timeout semantics, not a synthetic one) — `mmc.c` already has real
  spec-derived timeout constants sitting unused otherwise
  (`MMC_READ_TIMEOUT 150` /* ms, SD spec 4.6.2.1 */,
  `MMC_WRITE_TIMEOUT 500` /* ms, SD spec 4.6.2.2 */); binding them for real
  is strictly better than the retry-count fallback and costs nothing extra
  given `pic8-tick` is already proven family-agnostic.

## Public API design

```c
/* pic8-sdcard/include/pic8_sdcard.h */
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

typedef struct {
    GPIO_TypeDef  cs_port;   /* board-specific: which pin the card's CS is wired to */
    uint16_t      cs_pin;
} pic8_sdcard_pins_t;

/* Owns one mmc_card instance internally; only one card is in scope for
 * this plan (mmc.h's array-of-cards shape stays available to a future
 * caller who wants more, this module just doesn't multiplex it yet --
 * don't build multi-card support speculatively). */
bool     pic8_sdcard_init(const pic8_sdcard_pins_t *pins, uint32_t fosc_hz);
bool     pic8_sdcard_ready(void);
uint32_t pic8_sdcard_num_blocks(void);
bool     pic8_sdcard_read_block(uint32_t block_addr, uint8_t *data /* 512 B */);
bool     pic8_sdcard_write_block(uint32_t block_addr, const uint8_t *data /* 512 B */);
```

Thin on purpose: `mmc.h`'s functions are already the right shape (unlike
M-Stack's raw USB endpoint API, which genuinely needed `pic8-usb.c` to
invent ring buffering on top). This module's real work is the *binding*
layer — `mmc_config.h` pointing `MMC_SPI_TRANSFER`/`MMC_SPI_SET_CS` at
`HAL_SSP_WriteByte`/`HAL_GPIO_WritePin`, `MMC_SPI_SET_SPEED` at a small
Hz-to-`SSP_ModeTypeDef` divisor-picking helper (nearest-not-exceeding
among Fosc/4, /16, /64), and the timer macros at `pic8-tick` — plus
`pic8_sdcard_init/ready/num_blocks/read_block/write_block` as thin
call-throughs to `mmc_init`/`mmc_ready`/`mmc_get_num_blocks`/
`mmc_read_block`/`mmc_write_block` against the one owned `mmc_card`.
Multi-block write is real, spec-legitimate functionality but adds a
three-call state machine to the public API for a use case (streaming
writes across many blocks) this plan doesn't have a concrete caller for
yet — leave it reachable through the vendored `mmc.h` directly for now,
don't wrap it until something needs it.

**CS pin is caller-supplied, not assumed.** SCK/SDI/SDO are fixed to the
SSP peripheral's pins (RC3/RC4/RC5 per `pic18fxx5x_ssp.h`), but CS is
ordinary GPIO and different boards wire it to different pins — same
"don't assume the caller's hardware" reasoning `pic8-debounce`'s read
callback and `pic8-adcfilter`'s read callback already establish for this
repo, just via a GPIO pin pair instead of a function pointer since GPIO
control is already HAL-neutral.

## Host build story — genuinely stronger than pic8-usb's

`pic8-usb`'s host build could only test the ring-buffer logic this repo's
own code owns, because there is no faithful simulation of a real USB SIE
enumerating against a real host driver stack. **SD-over-SPI does not have
that problem** — it's a well-documented, deterministic byte-level
command/response protocol (send a command byte sequence, read a response
token, optionally clock out/in a data block + CRC16). A host build can
implement a **mock SPI slave** that plays the SD card's side of that
protocol (respond to `CMD0`/`CMD8`/`ACMD41`/`CMD17`/`CMD24` etc. the way a
real card would) and bind `MMC_SPI_TRANSFER` to it instead of real
hardware. That means `mmc_init_card`/`mmc_read_block`/`mmc_write_block`'s
actual logic — not just a hand-written stand-in for it, unlike
`pic8_usb_host_stub.c` — can be host-tested directly, the same
"host tests prove the shipped code" story `pic8-fsm`/`pic8-debounce`
already have. `crc.c`'s CRC7/CRC16 are pure math and trivially host-tested
against known SD CRC test vectors with zero mocking at all.

This is real design/implementation work (the mock SPI slave needs to
actually implement enough of the SD SPI command set to be worth trusting),
budget real time for it in Phase 2 — but it is a strictly better
validation story than what was available for the USB module, worth calling
out so the difference isn't missed.

## Milestones

- **Phase 1 — vendor `storage/`, confirm it's genuinely self-contained.**
  Extract into `third_party/m-stack-storage/`, confirm no leaked USB
  dependency, re-read `mmc.c`'s actual retry/timeout constants and
  multi-block state machine closely enough to be sure this plan's API
  sketch is accurate (same "confirm before coding" discipline
  `pic8-usb-plan.md` used).
- **Phase 2 — binding layer + mock-SPI host tests.** `pic8_sdcard.h/.c`,
  the `HAL_SSP`/`HAL_GPIO`/`pic8-tick` bindings, the clock-divisor helper,
  the mock SPI slave, `tests/test_pic8_sdcard.c`. Given this environment
  has XC8 actually installed (per `pic8-usb`'s Phase 2), also attempt a
  real `xc8-cc` compile+link against PIC18F4550 the same way, including
  checking real RAM footprint against the "Open risks" concern below —
  don't just estimate it.
- **Phase 3 — real hardware.** `mcu/pic18fxx5x-sdcard-mplabx/Makefile`,
  wire an actual SD card breakout to a real board's SPI pins + a chosen CS
  pin, confirm `mmc_init_card` actually succeeds against a real card and a
  read/write/read round-trip matches. Real-card-only; no amount of host
  mocking substitutes for this, same caveat `pic8-usb-plan.md` has for USB
  enumeration.
- **Phase 4 — docs.** `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/API.md`,
  `pic8-sdcard/README.md`, root `README.md` component-table row.

## Open risks to resolve during implementation, not now

- **RAM headroom if combined with `pic8-usb` in one firmware image.**
  `pic8-usb`'s wrapper alone measured 454 bytes; a 512-byte block buffer
  plus the `mmc_card` struct pushes a combined image well past 1000 bytes
  of a 2048-byte budget before the caller's own application logic. Fine
  standalone; worth a real combined-build check in Phase 2 if the two are
  ever meant to ship together (e.g. a USB mass-storage device exposing the
  SD card — `apps/msc_test/` in the vendored M-Stack tree is exactly that
  combination, and a plausible future module, not in this plan's scope).
- **SPI clock divisor granularity.** Fosc/4, /16, /64, and TMR2/2 are the
  only options `SSP_ModeTypeDef` exposes; the nearest-not-exceeding helper
  may land meaningfully under a card's actual max supported speed for some
  `Fosc`/target-speed combinations. Not a correctness problem (SD cards
  tolerate being clocked slower than their max), but worth noting in
  `docs/API.md` so a caller chasing throughput knows to check the actual
  achieved rate, not just the requested one.
- **Multi-block write correctness is unverified** until Phase 3 — it's
  real M-Stack code, not something being newly written, but nothing in
  Phase 1/2 exercises it (this plan doesn't wrap it yet, see "Public API
  design" above).

Not committing any of this until the user reviews Phase 1's findings —
implementation proceeds when they say go, git history stays theirs to
curate.
