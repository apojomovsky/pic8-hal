/**
 * @file    target/pic16f193x_platform.h
 * @brief   Real-target platform: how SFRs are accessed and how the weak
 *          attribute is spelled, for the XC8 build.
 *
 * @details
 *   Target half of the SFR mapping layer (paired with
 *   host/pic16f193x_platform.h); the build's include path picks which
 *   resolves, so pic16f193x.h includes this name unconditionally with no
 *   `#ifdef`. SFR access is a direct volatile dereference of the literal
 *   address; XC8 has no weak symbols, so EPIC_WEAK is empty.
 *
 *   Plain C reads against compile-time-constant SFR tokens compile to
 *   `movlb N; movf <sfr>,w` once XC8 sees which bank each token belongs
 *   to (it pulls the bank map from the DFP at -O2). That is why
 *   `EPIC_REG8(addr)` dereferences the literal address without bank
 *   switching: XC8 sets BSR itself. Verified on the Enhanced Mid-range
 *   core by the Foundation's codegen probe (`docs/adding-a-device.md` §4,
 *   Finding 1 of the foundation ARCHITECTURE.md).
 *
 *   PIE1/PIE2/PIE3 enable/disable is NOT a plain-C read-modify-write:
 *   on this core, the original plain-C RMW shape silently produced
 *   `movwf fsr1l; clrf fsr1h` indirect addressing with FSR1H=0, which
 *   is not what PIE1 lives behind (PIE1 is at 0x91 in bank 1, not in
 *   the linear address space FSR1 reads with FSR1H=0). The fix mirrors
 *   pic16f87xa-hal's proven `__at()`-pinned scratch byte +
 *   inline-asm bank-switch pattern, on the Enhanced Mid-range idiom
 *   (`movlb 1` sets BSR=1 in one instruction). All three PIEs are in
 *   bank 1 (DS41364B Tables 2-4), so a single `movlb 1` covers all
 *   three pir_index values (0/1/2). See
 *   pic16f193x-hal/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md Finding 2 for the failing
 *   codegen evidence (FSR1H=0 read of address 0x91) and the fixed
 *   assembly (`movlb 1; iorwf PIE1,f; movlb 0`).
