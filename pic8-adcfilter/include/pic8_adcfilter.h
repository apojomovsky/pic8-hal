/**
 * @file    pic8_adcfilter.h
 * @brief   Vendor-agnostic ADC oversampling and moving-average filter.
 *          Zero dependencies beyond <stdint.h>.
 *
 * @details
 *   Two composable utilities for noisy 10-bit ADC readings on 8-bit PICs:
 *
 *   - `pic8_adcfilter_oversample`: the standard oversample-and-decimate
 *     technique (average 4^n raw samples, right-shift by n) to gain n extra
 *     bits of effective resolution.
 *   - `pic8_adcfilter_avg_push`: an O(1) moving average over a caller-owned
 *     ring buffer with a running sum.
 *
 *   Both are fully vendor-agnostic: the core never calls `HAL_ADC_Read`; it
 *   takes a `pic8_adcfilter_read_fn` callback, so it works over any HAL
 *   family's ADC, a simulated/mock source in tests, or any 16-bit numeric
 *   source someone wants smoothed. The header and implementation depend on
 *   nothing beyond `<stdint.h>`, making this the most directly host-testable
 *   module in the repo: the host suite tests literally the same code that
 *   ships on-target.
