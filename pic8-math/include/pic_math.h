/**
 * @file    pic_math.h
 * @brief   Family-agnostic fixed-point math utility library for 8-bit PICs.
 *
 * @details
 *   `pic8-math` is a stateless computation library ported from two 1997
 *   Microchip application notes -- AN526 ("PIC16C5X/PIC16CXXX Math Utility
 *   Routines", DS00526) and AN544 ("Math Utility Routines", DS00544) --
 *   modernized into one family-agnostic C library with a hand-written
 *   inline-asm core. It targets the same two families this repo already
 *   supports: PIC16F87XA (mid-range core, no hardware multiply) and
 *   PIC18F2455/2550/4455/4550 (PIC18 core, with the single-cycle `MULWF`
 *   8x8->16 hardware multiply neither app note's target chip had).
 *
 *   The design follows the repo's shared-core/per-family-backend pattern
 *   (see docs/multi-family-plan.md): one neutral public API (this header,
 *   no `#ifdef` for family), a portable-C host backend that doubles as the
 *   independent test oracle, a PIC16 inline-asm backend, and a PIC18
 *   inline-asm backend that exploits hardware the app notes' chips lacked.
 *   Only the true leaf arithmetic primitives get per-family inline asm;
 *   everything expressible in terms of them -- square root, numerical
 *   differentiation/integration, the RNGs -- is written once in portable C
 *   under src/common/ and is identical on every family.
 *
 *   This is also a deliberate improvement over the source material.
 *   AN526/AN544 hang every routine's operands off fixed, conventionally-
 *   agreed RAM addresses (ACCaLO/ACCaHI/..., documented in a "Data RAM
 *   Requirements" table the caller must respect and never reuse across
 *   calls). That is a reentrancy and testability hazard -- nothing stops
 *   two call sites colliding on ACCa. This API passes everything by
 *   value/pointer instead; there is no global mutable arithmetic state
 *   anywhere, including the RNGs (explicit `uint16_t *state` in/out, not a
 *   hidden global "current seed").
 *
 *   Unlike the peripheral-driver HAL headers, this is a stateless
 *   computation library, not a peripheral, so the API is plain `pic_math_*`
 *   snake_case functions with explicit parameters and return values. It
 *   needs no HAL contract header at all -- only <stdint.h>/<stdbool.h> --
 *   so the host unit-test build links the library with no HAL dependency.
 *   The family dimension lives entirely in the XC8 Makefile targets under
 *   mcu/, which pick the per-family asm backend; the CMake host build picks
 *   the portable-C src/host/ backend.
 *
 *   See docs/ARCHITECTURE.md for the backend split and the inline-asm
 *   operand-binding convention, and docs/API.md for the per-function
 *   reference.
