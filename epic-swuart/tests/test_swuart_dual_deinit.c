/**
 * @file    test_swuart_dual_deinit.c
 * @brief   Regression for the Timer1-teardown bug found and fixed while
 *          building the second channel (Task 6): EPIC_SWUART_DeInit
 *          used to call EPIC_TIMER1_DeInit() unconditionally, tearing
 *          down the shared Timer1 regardless of which channel was being
 *          removed. On PIC16F193X, where both channels share one
 *          Timer1 instance, that would silently break a still-active
 *          sibling channel. The fix (current epic_swuart.c) makes
 *          Timer1 teardown conditional on BOTH channel slots being
 *          empty (`g_chan_a == NULL && g_chan_b == NULL`).
 *
 *          This test inits two channels, uses both, DeInits one, and
 *          then genuinely exercises the survivor: not just "does its
 *          handle struct look untouched" but "does it still transmit
 *          and receive a correct byte", the only way software running
 *          entirely on directly-fired test hooks (no real Timer1/CCP
 *          hardware exists in the host sim) can actually catch a
 *          regression here. It also reads the Timer1 (T1CON) and CCP
 *          CON SFRs directly (same EPIC_REG8 mechanism
 *          swuart_test_last_tx_mode uses internally) to confirm the
 *          *hardware* state matches: Timer1 still running and the
 *          survivor's own CCP instances untouched right after the
 *          sibling's DeInit, and Timer1 actually torn down once the
 *          survivor itself is later DeInit'd too.
 *
 *          PIC16F193X only, the only family with two full CCP RX+TX
 *          pairs; compiles to an empty, trivially-passing translation
 *          unit on the other two families instead of failing to build
 *          there (same pattern as test_swuart_dual.c).
