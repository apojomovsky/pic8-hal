/**
 * @file    host/pic16f87xa_platform.h
 * @brief   Host-simulation platform: how SFRs are stored and how the weak
 *          attribute is spelled, for the CMake host build.
 *
 * @details
 *   Host half of the SFR mapping layer (paired with
 *   target/pic16f87xa_platform.h for the XC8 build); the build's include
 *   path picks which one resolves, so pic16f87xa.h includes this name
 *   unconditionally with no `#ifdef`. SFR access indexes the 512-byte
 *   memory-backed pic16f87xa_sim_sfr[] (src/sim/pic16f87xa_sim.c), so
 *   tests can poke registers directly.
