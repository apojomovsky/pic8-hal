/**
 * @file    pic16f87xa_sim.h
 * @brief   Public API for the PIC16F87XA host simulation backend.
 *
 * @details
 *   Compiling with `-DPIC16F87XA_USE_SIMULATOR` redirects every SFR access
 *   into a host-side register file (see @ref pic16f87xa_sfr.h). The hooks
 *   declared here let a test rig:
 *     - poke inputs (e.g. drive RB0 high),
 *     - read outputs (e.g. read what PORTB is doing),
 *     - step the simulated timers / A/D / USART,
 *     - simulate interrupts.
 *
 *   The simulator models the most-used peripherals (Timer0, GPIO, ADC
 *   front-end); other peripherals are pure software and just expose
 *   register-level access. See README in src/sim/ for the full list.
