/**

 * @brief   Real-target platform: how SFRs are accessed and how the weak
 *          attribute is spelled, for the XC8 build.
 *
 * @details
 *   Target half of the SFR mapping layer (paired with
 *   host/pic16f87xa_platform.h); the build's include path picks which
 *   resolves, so pic16f87xa.h includes this name unconditionally with no
 *   `#ifdef`. SFR access is a direct volatile dereference of the literal
 *   address; XC8 has no weak symbols, so EPIC_WEAK is empty.
