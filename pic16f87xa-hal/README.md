# PIC16F87XA HAL

Hardware abstraction layer for the **PIC16F873A / 874A / 876A / 877A** family,
inspired by the STM32Cube HAL API. Every constant, register address and
behaviour is taken 1-to-1 from the datasheet [DS39582B](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/39582b.pdf).

## Status

Done so far:

- ✅ Family header (device select, status codes, SFR macros)
- ✅ SFR map with bit definitions
- ✅ Pre-processor SFR mapping layer (host sim + XC8 target, same source)
- ✅ Host simulation backend (Timer0/1/2 + GPIO + IRQ hook)
- ✅ Interrupt core (HAL_NVIC-style enable/disable/clear/status)
- ✅ GPIO driver (GPIOA..GPIOE, pull-ups, init/read/write/toggle)
- ✅ **Timer0 driver** (handle, prescaler, clock source, weak ISR)
- ✅ **Timer1 driver** (16-bit, prescaler, T1OSC, weak ISR)
- ✅ **Timer2 driver** (PR2, prescaler, postscaler, weak ISR)
- ✅ **CCP1 / CCP2 driver** (Capture / Compare / PWM, weak ISRs)
- ✅ **USART driver** (async + sync, SPBRG baud-rate computation, weak ISRs)
- ✅ **MSSP driver** (SPI master/slave + I²C master/slave, register-level)
- ✅ **ADC driver** (10-bit, 5/8 channels, TAD clock + reference config, weak ISR)
- ✅ **Comparator driver** (2 comparators, 8 modes, weak ISR)
- ✅ **Vref driver** (16-tap ladder, low/high range, mV helper)
- ✅ **EEPROM driver** (read/write/buffer, mandatory 0x55/0xAA unlock, weak ISR)
- ✅ **PSP driver** (40/44-pin only — TRISE PSPMODE, IBF/OBF/IBOV flag helpers)
- ✅ **WDT / BOR / Sleep helpers** (clrwdt / sleep asm, PCON BOR/POR flags)
- ✅ **Shared interrupt dispatch** (`pic16f87xa_dispatch_all_irqs`) — fans the single vector at 0x0004 out to every peripheral IRQHandler. On a real target the XC8 `__interrupt()` (`src/core/pic16f87xa_isr_vector.c`) calls it; on the host the harness registers it as the sim IRQ callback. One source of truth.
- ✅ **Test/firmware harness** (`include/core/pic16f87xa_harness.h`) — lets every example build for the host sim and a real XC8 target with **no `#ifdef` in the example code**. The build links the host harness (`*_harness_sim.c`) or the target harness (`*_harness_target.c`); the harness abstracts the only two execution-model differences (pumping simulated time vs. real time, terminating test vs. firmware that runs forever).
- ✅ **MPLAB X / XC8 project template** (Makefile + `nbproject/configurations.xml`)
- ✅ End-to-end tests: `example_blink`, `example_idle_blink`, `example_timer1`, `example_timer2`, `example_ccp_pwm`, `example_usart`, `example_ssp`, `example_adc`, `example_comp_vref`, `example_eeprom`, `example_psp`, `example_wdt_sleep`

**All planned peripherals + XC8 build glue done.**

## Build (host simulation)

```sh
cmake -B build -S .
cmake --build build

./build/example_blink
./build/example_blink_PIC16F873A
./build/example_blink_PIC16F874A
./build/example_blink_PIC16F876A
./build/example_blink_PIC16F877A
```

## Build (real target)

The HAL compiles against XC8 via the same sources. The host/target split
is done at **build time, not with `#ifdef`**: the XC8 Makefile puts
`include/target` ahead of `include` on the include path, so
`pic16f87xa_platform.h` resolves to the real-target version (SFR macros
= direct volatile dereference) and the target-side harness / WDT-sleep /
interrupt-vector implementations are linked. The MPLAB X project lives
under `mcu/pic16f87xa-mplabx/`; its Makefile produces `<MCU>-firmware.hex`
via `xc8-cc`.

## The simulation middleware

The same source file works on host and on-target with **no `#ifdef` around
code**: the build selects the platform by include path, and the
execution-model differences by which harness implementation it links.

`include/pic16f87xa.h` pulls in `pic16f87xa_platform.h`, which exists in
two same-named copies:

```c
/* include/host/pic16f87xa_platform.h  (CMake build) */
extern uint8_t pic16f87xa_sim_sfr[0x200];
#define pic16f87xa_sfr_read8(addr)   (pic16f87xa_sim_sfr[(uint16_t)(addr)])
#define pic16f87xa_sfr_write8(addr, v) pic16f87xa_sim_sfr[(uint16_t)(addr)] = (v)

/* include/target/pic16f87xa_platform.h  (XC8 build) */
#define pic16f87xa_sfr_read8(addr)   (*(volatile uint8_t *)(uintptr_t)(addr))
#define pic16f87xa_sfr_write8(addr, v) (*(volatile uint8_t *)(uintptr_t)(addr)) = (v)
```

CMake puts `include/host` first on the include path; the XC8 Makefile puts
`include/target` first — so the one `#include "pic16f87xa_platform.h"` in
`pic16f87xa.h` resolves to the right copy per build, with no preprocessor
branching.

Likewise the test/firmware harness (`core/pic16f87xa_harness.h`) and the
WDT/Sleep helpers are each provided by two implementation files —
`*_sim.c` linked by CMake, `*_target.c` linked by the XC8 Makefile — so
examples call `pic16f87xa_harness_init/tick/running/log`,
`HAL_WDT_Refresh`, `HAL_Sleep_Enter` unconditionally and the build picks
the behaviour. See `core/pic16f87xa_harness.h` for the rationale.

On host, every SFR read/write is a memory access into a 512-byte array
(`pic16f87xa_sim_sfr`). On a real PIC, the same macro dereferences the
literal address — exactly the same code the XC8 linker would generate
from `*(volatile uint8_t *)&PORTB`.

The simulation backend additionally:

- Implements Timer0 with prescaler and overflow interrupt.
- Models PORTA..PORTE read-modify-write semantics (writes only update
  the latch; reads depend on TRIS).
- Lets the host application drive external pin levels
  (`pic16f87xa_sim_drive_input`) and observe what the chip is
  driving (`pic16f87xa_sim_read_output`).
- Forwards simulated interrupts to the shared dispatcher
  (`pic16f87xa_dispatch_all_irqs`, registered by the host harness).

This means **the same `tests/example_blink.c` compiles unchanged for
host simulation or for an XC8-built firmware targeting a real PIC**.

## Datasheet citations

Every register, bit name, reset value and reset condition is annotated
with the section of DS39582B it came from. Examples:

- `pic16f87xa_sfr.h` → `/* DS39582B Table 4-3 — PORTB functions */`
- `pic16f87xa_gpio.c` → `HAL_GPIO_Init()` cites §4.x
- `core/pic16f87xa_interrupt.h` → every IRQn cites §14.11

If you find a deviation, that's a bug.

## API conventions

Mirror STM32Cube as closely as makes sense for an 8-bit PIC:

- `HAL_PPP_Init(handle, init_struct)` — peripheral bring-up
- `HAL_PPP_DeInit(handle)` — peripheral tear-down
- `HAL_PPP_MspInit()` — `__weak` callback the user overrides to wire ISR vectors
- Pin/port addressing: `GPIOA..GPIOE`, `GPIO_PIN_0..GPIO_PIN_All`,
  `GPIO_PIN_SET/RESET`
- Status codes: `PIC16F87XA_OK / ERROR / BUSY / TIMEOUT / INVALID`
- IRQ enum: `PIC16F87XA_IRQ_TMR0 / _TMR1 / _CCP1 / ...`

Cube users will feel at home. PIC users will see familiar peripheral names
with the abstraction they always wished for.
