/**
 * @file    pic16_isr_vector.c
 * @brief   Real-target interrupt-vector entry (XC8 target build only).
 *
 * @details
 *   The PIC16F87XA family has a single interrupt vector at 0x0004
 *   (DS39582B §14.11). On a real XC8 target this file installs the
 *   `__interrupt()` handler the CPU jumps to on any enabled IRQ. It just
 *   calls the shared fan-out @ref pic8_dispatch_all_irqs, which
 *   routes to every peripheral IRQHandler.
 *
 *   This file is built only by the XC8 Makefile (real target). The host
 *   CMake build does NOT compile it, `__interrupt()` is an XC8-specific
 *   attribute and the host has no interrupt vector, so the selection is
 *   done at build time, with no `#ifdef` here. On the host the harness
 *   registers the same dispatcher as the sim IRQ callback instead.

 * peripheral handlers. */
