/**
 * @file    pic16_harness_sim.c
 * @brief   PIC16F87XA host-simulation implementation of the test harness
 *          (see core/pic8_harness.h).
 *
 * @details
 *   Linked by the CMake host build. The companion target implementation
 *   is the family-blind pic8_harness_target.c in pic8-common; the build
 *   picks one, so neither this file nor the examples need `#ifdef`. This
 *   file is PIC16-specific only because it pumps the PIC16 simulator; the
 *   harness contract it implements is shared by every family.
