/**
 * @file    pic16f87xa_wdt_sleep_sim.c
 * @brief   Host-simulation implementation of HAL_WDT_Refresh / HAL_Sleep_Enter.
 *
 * @details
 *   Linked by the CMake host build. The companion target implementation
 *   is pic16f87xa_wdt_sleep_target.c; the build picks one, so neither
 *   this file nor the examples need `#ifdef`. On the host there is no
 *   watchdog and execution does not stop, so both are no-ops. The shared
 *   BOR/POR status helpers live in pic16f87xa_wdt_sleep.c.
