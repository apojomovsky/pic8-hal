/**
 * @file    example_blink.c
 * @brief   Blink an LED on RB0 from a Timer0 overflow, the canonical
 *          "the HAL drives a real application" smoke test.
 *
 * @details
 *   One source builds for both the host simulation backend and a real XC8
 *   target with no `#ifdef` in the code: the build selects the harness
 *   implementation (core/pic8_harness.h), which abstracts the only
 *   two execution-model differences, pumping simulated time vs. real
 *   time advancing on its own, and a terminating pass/fail test vs.
 *   firmware that runs forever.
 *
 *   Timer0 overflows drive an interrupt; the ISR toggles RB0. The main
 *   loop just lets time pass (pumping the sim on the host, busy-spinning
 *   on the target) and refreshes the WDT, the peripheral does the work.
 *
 *   Wiring (real target): LED + resistor between RB0 and GND
 *   (active-high); 20 MHz crystal on OSC1/OSC2 → FOSC = HS, FCY = 5 MHz.
 *   Timer0 internal Fosc/4, 1:256 prescaler, reload 0 → overflow every
 *   256 × 256 × 0.2 µs ≈ 13 ms, so RB0 toggles ~76×/s (a fast blink).
 *   The WDT (enabled in the config word) is refreshed in the main loop.
