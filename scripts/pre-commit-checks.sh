# scripts/pre-commit-checks.sh, the actual pre-commit logic. Installed into
# .git/hooks/pre-commit by scripts/install-git-hooks.sh (see scripts/README.md
# for what each check does and why clang-format is not one of them yet).
#
# Every check here operates on staged content, not the working tree, except
# the newline/whitespace fixer, which edits the working tree file in place
# and then asks you to re-`git add` it (never silently changes what gets
# committed without you seeing it). If you staged only part of a file with
# `git add -p`, the fixer still touches the whole working-tree file; review
# `git diff` before re-adding in that case.
