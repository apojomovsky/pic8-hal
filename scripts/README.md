# Dev environment scripts

Covers the host-toolchain bootstrap and pre-commit hook below. For
real-target XC8 builds and the `mdb` (MPLAB SIM) verification gate
without installing XC8/MPLAB X yourself, see the root
[`Makefile`](../Makefile) and [`docs/docker-dev-plan.md`](../docs/docker-dev-plan.md)
instead, everything runs inside a Docker image built from installers you
drop in `docker/ci-toolchain/vendor/`. `scripts/sim-mdb-run.sh` and
`scripts/sim-test-local.sh` (this directory) are the lower-level pieces
that flow reuses; their own header comments cover direct use if you
need it.

## Bootstrap

```sh
./scripts/bootstrap.sh              # install missing host packages + the git hook
./scripts/bootstrap.sh --check-only # report what's missing, install nothing,
                                     # exit nonzero if anything is missing
```

One-time (idempotent) setup for a fresh clone: installs the host toolchain
the CMake builds need (`cmake`, `build-essential`, `cppcheck`,
`clang-format`, via `apt-get`, so Debian/Ubuntu; other package managers
get a printed package list instead of an auto-install), then runs
`install-git-hooks.sh` below. Also checks whether `xc8-cc` is on `PATH`
and points at the README if it isn't. Real-target (XC8) builds need
MPLAB X + MPLAB XC8 v3.x installed manually (proprietary, license-gated,
an interactive installer, not something this script attempts); host
builds work fine without it.

## Pre-commit hook

Installed on its own, or as part of `bootstrap.sh` above:

```sh
./scripts/install-git-hooks.sh
```

This symlinks `.git/hooks/pre-commit` to `scripts/pre-commit-checks.sh`
(`.git/hooks/` isn't tracked by git, so every clone needs to run the
installer once). Uninstall by deleting `.git/hooks/pre-commit`, or skip it
for one commit with `git commit --no-verify`.

### What it checks

1. **Trailing newline / trailing whitespace.** Auto-fixes the working-tree
   file, then blocks the commit and asks you to `git diff`, review, and
   `git add` again. Never silently changes what gets committed without you
   seeing it. If you staged only part of a file with `git add -p`, this
   still edits the whole working-tree file, review before re-adding.
2. **No em dashes**, this repo's documented style rule (`AGENTS.md`:
   "not in docs, not in commit messages, not in code comments"). Scoped to
   lines your commit actually *adds*, not the whole staged file: this repo
   has some pre-existing em-dashes from before the rule was adopted, and a
   whole-file check would block any unrelated commit that merely touches
   one of those files. Not auto-fixed (picking a comma vs. a colon vs. a
   period needs a human), the commit is blocked with the offending
   `file:line`.
3. **`cppcheck`** on staged `.c` files (`--enable=warning,performance,
   portability`), a real static-analysis gate (uninitialized variables,
   null derefs, etc.), not a style check. `unusedFunction` and
   `missingInclude`/`missingIncludeSystem` are suppressed: cppcheck
   analyzes one file at a time here, so it cannot see that a module's
   public functions are called from its own tests/examples or from other
   modules, and would otherwise flag every public API function in every
   module as dead code. Skipped with a notice if `cppcheck` isn't
   installed.

### What it deliberately does not check yet: `clang-format`

A starter `.clang-format` is in the repo root, but it is **not** wired
into the hook. Tested against a real file (`epic-pid/src/pid.c`) before
deciding this: even a style hand-picked to match this codebase's actual
conventions (4-space indent, `Stroustrup` brace style: own-line brace for
functions, attached brace for `if`/`while`/`else`) still reformatted
things this codebase does deliberately, aligned `struct` field/assignment
comments into columns, single-line `if (x) { y; }` clamp idioms expanded
across multiple lines, `} else {` split onto two lines. That is real
diff noise on files nobody actually changed the meaning of, not a bug in
the config, clang-format does not have a "match this file's existing
hand-tuned alignment" mode.

If you want to use it anyway for a specific file, `git clang-format
--diff` shows what would change without applying it, and only considers
lines your commit touches, not the whole file. Tightening `.clang-format`
enough to stop fighting this codebase's style (or deciding to reformat
the codebase once and live with the new style going forward) is future
work, not done here.

### Manual run

```sh
git add <files>
bash scripts/pre-commit-checks.sh
```

Runs the exact same checks the hook runs, without committing.

### CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml`'s `host` job runs this same script
against a fresh checkout, which has nothing staged (everything is already
committed). Setting `PRE_COMMIT_BASE_REF=<ref>` switches every check from
"staged index vs. `HEAD`" to "`<ref>` vs. `HEAD`", so a PR gets exactly the
same em-dash/whitespace/cppcheck rules applied to the lines it actually
changed, not the whole tree (which would also flag this repo's
pre-existing violations from before the rules were adopted). Local,
hook-driven runs are unaffected: the variable is unset there, so behavior
is identical to before.

## CI change-scoping (docs-only skip, affected-module narrowing)

Two more scripts, each with a full header comment covering the "why",
used by `ci.yml`'s two jobs to avoid paying for a docs-only PR or a PR
that only touches one module:

- `ci-docs-only-check.sh <base-ref>`: prints `true`/`false`, used by the
  `target` job to skip its Docker-based steps (image pull already
  excepted, a `docker pull` against a cached tag is cheap either way)
  entirely on a documentation-only PR diff.
- `ci-discover-affected-modules.py [base-ref]`: used by the `host` job's
  own discovery step. Same docs-only concept as above,
  plus a second question the `host` job specifically needs: which
  modules were actually touched, directly or through a sibling
  dependency (read straight from each module's own `CMakeLists.txt`,
  no separately-maintained dependency graph to drift). Conservative on
  both axes, falls back to the full, unfiltered module list the moment
  it sees a changed file it can't attribute to a known module or
  `epic-common/`. Only ever applied to `pull_request` runs; every push
  to `master` always gets the full matrix regardless of what changed,
  so a wrong narrowing on some PR can only delay when a break is
  caught, never let it merge unverified.

## CI target-job scripts (`ci-target-*.sh`)

Committed shell scripts, not inline workflow YAML, so they can be
shellchecked and dry-run locally against the real toolchain rather than
only ever exercised inside a GitHub Actions run. `ci.yml`'s `target` job
runs each one via `docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/work" -w /work <image>
bash scripts/ci-target-*.sh`, bind-mounting the checkout instead of the
old per-job `container:` field (this job also needs `python3`, which the
toolchain image deliberately doesn't have, so no single `container:`
value could cover every step in the job). None of the three stop at the
first failure; each writes a `ci-summary-*.md` PASS/FAIL table the
calling workflow step cats into `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` afterward (a file
on the runner, not reliably reachable from inside the container the
scripts themselves run in).

- `ci-target-build.sh [matrix.txt] [summary.md]`: real XC8 build for
  every `family module mcu` triple in `matrix.txt` (plain text, one
  triple per line, emitted by `ci.yml`'s emit step; deliberately not
  JSON, since the container has no `jq` either).
- `ci-target-sim.sh [summary.md]`: the fixed 3-entry `mdb`/MPLAB SIM run
  list (one per family), via `sim-mdb-run.sh`.
- `ci-target-bundle.sh [bundles-dir] [summary.md]`: the isolated bundle
  build, proving each generated bundle is self-contained by building it
  from `/isolated` (no repo above it) rather than in place. Also builds
  each bundle's reference MPLAB X project headlessly (see
  `docs/superpowers/plans/probe-mplabx-headless.md`).

## `epic_build.py`, the real-target build driver

Reads `epic-common/manifest/modules.toml`, resolves a module's
dependencies and sources, and emits a POSIX `sh` script of `xc8-cc`
invocations. Replaces the `mcu/*-mplabx/Makefile`s.

```sh
python3 scripts/epic_build.py build --module epic-serial --mcu 16F877A --run
python3 scripts/epic_build.py matrix          # CI matrix JSON
python3 scripts/epic_build.py report --log build/16F877A/build.log
```

Without `--run` it only writes `build/<MCU>/build.sh`, which is the mode
CI uses: resolution needs python3, execution does not, and the toolchain
container has no python3 in it (`docker/ci-toolchain/Dockerfile`).
Reading that script is also the fastest way to see the exact command
line for any translation unit.

An unsupported `(module, MCU)` pair fails immediately with the reason
recorded in the manifest, rather than as a wall of XC8 linker errors.
`--fosc-hz` overrides the family's default oscillator frequency; an
example with no `config` table in the manifest compiles with no config
translation unit at all, matching the Makefiles that never had one
either. `epic-common/manifest/README.md` documents the schema this
driver reads.

## `make_bundle.py`, the release bundle generator

Assembles a self-contained, per-family source tree from the manifest,
plus the generated consumer files (`epicurus.mk`,
`epicurus-sources.json`, `SUPPORT.md`, `QUICKSTART.md`, `MPLABX.md`).

```sh
python3 scripts/make_bundle.py --family PIC16F87XA --version v0.1.0
```

Output lands in `bundles/`, which is gitignored: bundles are build
output, attached to a GitHub Release, never committed.

`bundlegen.py` holds the generation logic and is where every emitted
file's format lives. `.github/workflows/ci.yml`'s `target` job (its
"Isolated bundle build" step, `scripts/ci-target-bundle.sh`) proves a
bundle is self-contained by building it from a scratch directory
outside the repo.
