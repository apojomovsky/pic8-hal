# Dev environment scripts

## Bootstrap

```sh
./scripts/bootstrap.sh              # install missing host packages + the git hook
./scripts/bootstrap.sh --check-only # report what's missing, install nothing,
                                     # exit nonzero if anything is missing
```

One-time (idempotent) setup for a fresh clone: installs the host toolchain
the CMake builds need (`cmake`, `build-essential`, `cppcheck`,
`clang-format`, via `apt-get`, so Debian/Ubuntu; other package managers
get a printed package list instead of an auto-install), then runs
`install-git-hooks.sh` below. Also checks whether `xc8-cc` is on `PATH`
and points at the README if it isn't. Real-target (XC8) builds need
MPLAB X + MPLAB XC8 v3.x installed manually (proprietary, license-gated,
an interactive installer, not something this script attempts); host
builds work fine without it.

## Pre-commit hook

Installed on its own, or as part of `bootstrap.sh` above:

```sh
./scripts/install-git-hooks.sh
```

This symlinks `.git/hooks/pre-commit` to `scripts/pre-commit-checks.sh`
(`.git/hooks/` isn't tracked by git, so every clone needs to run the
installer once). Uninstall by deleting `.git/hooks/pre-commit`, or skip it
for one commit with `git commit --no-verify`.

### What it checks

1. **Trailing newline / trailing whitespace.** Auto-fixes the working-tree
   file, then blocks the commit and asks you to `git diff`, review, and
   `git add` again. Never silently changes what gets committed without you
   seeing it. If you staged only part of a file with `git add -p`, this
   still edits the whole working-tree file, review before re-adding.
2. **No em dashes**, this repo's documented style rule (`AGENTS.md`:
   "not in docs, not in commit messages, not in code comments"). Scoped to
   lines your commit actually *adds*, not the whole staged file: this repo
   has some pre-existing em-dashes from before the rule was adopted, and a
   whole-file check would block any unrelated commit that merely touches
   one of those files. Not auto-fixed (picking a comma vs. a colon vs. a
   period needs a human), the commit is blocked with the offending
   `file:line`.
3. **`cppcheck`** on staged `.c` files (`--enable=warning,performance,
   portability`), a real static-analysis gate (uninitialized variables,
   null derefs, etc.), not a style check. `unusedFunction` and
   `missingInclude`/`missingIncludeSystem` are suppressed: cppcheck
   analyzes one file at a time here, so it cannot see that a module's
   public functions are called from its own tests/examples or from other
   modules, and would otherwise flag every public API function in every
   module as dead code. Skipped with a notice if `cppcheck` isn't
   installed.

### What it deliberately does not check yet: `clang-format`

A starter `.clang-format` is in the repo root, but it is **not** wired
into the hook. Tested against a real file (`pic8-pid/src/pid.c`) before
deciding this: even a style hand-picked to match this codebase's actual
conventions (4-space indent, `Stroustrup` brace style: own-line brace for
functions, attached brace for `if`/`while`/`else`) still reformatted
things this codebase does deliberately, aligned `struct` field/assignment
comments into columns, single-line `if (x) { y; }` clamp idioms expanded
across multiple lines, `} else {` split onto two lines. That is real
diff noise on files nobody actually changed the meaning of, not a bug in
the config, clang-format does not have a "match this file's existing
hand-tuned alignment" mode.

If you want to use it anyway for a specific file, `git clang-format
--diff` shows what would change without applying it, and only considers
lines your commit touches, not the whole file. Tightening `.clang-format`
enough to stop fighting this codebase's style (or deciding to reformat
the codebase once and live with the new style going forward) is future
work, not done here.

### Manual run

```sh
git add <files>
bash scripts/pre-commit-checks.sh
```

Runs the exact same checks the hook runs, without committing.
