/**
 * @file    pic18_harness_sim.c
 * @brief   PIC18F2455 family host-simulation implementation of the test
 *          harness (see core/pic8_harness.h).
 *
 * @details
 *   Linked by the CMake host build. The companion target implementation is
 *   the family-blind pic8_harness_target.c in pic8-common; the build picks
 *   one, so neither this file nor the examples need `#ifdef`. This file is
 *   PIC18-specific only because it pumps the PIC18 simulator; the harness
 *   contract it implements is shared by every family.
 *
 *   Phase 1: the sim step is a no-op, so `pic8_harness_tick` advances
 *   nothing, but the wiring (reset + register the family dispatcher as the
 *   sim IRQ callback) is real and identical to the PIC16 host harness.
