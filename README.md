[![Runs on: host & silicon](https://img.shields.io/badge/runs%20on-host%20%26%20silicon-orange.svg)](#quick-start)

A datasheet-faithful hardware abstraction layer and a set of firmware
building blocks (scheduler, FSM, math, timebase, serial, bus, storage,
control) for 8-bit PIC microcontrollers, in the spirit of STM32Cube HAL
but for parts with no vendor HAL of their own.

Every module dual-builds from the same source: a host simulation backend
(gcc/CMake, runs as a normal program, no hardware required) and a
real-target build (MPLAB XC8, produces a `.hex`). Applications never
`#ifdef` between them, the split happens at build time via include-path
and linked-file selection.

## Why

- **Datasheet-faithful.** Every register, bit name, and reset value is
  taken 1-to-1 from the Microchip datasheets
  ([DS39582B](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/39582b.pdf)
  for PIC16F87XA,
  [DS39632E](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/39632e.pdf)
  for PIC18F2455), cited in the source and in each family's `MANUAL.md`.
- **Test on a laptop, not just on silicon.** Every module builds and runs
  as a host program under CMake/ctest. Firmware logic gets exercised long
  before it touches a programmer.
- **Two families, one contract.** `pic8-common/` holds everything
  architecture-blind (status codes, the harness, shared build
  fragments); each family HAL implements the same names and signatures
  over different registers. Higher-level modules (scheduler, protocol
  stacks, drivers) are written once and build against either family
  unchanged.
- **No framework tax.** No RTOS, no dynamic allocation, no C++. Plain C99,
  cooperative scheduling, static storage. Every module is usable on its
  own; nothing requires pulling in the rest of the tree.

## Quick start

Build and run the multi-blink example on the host simulator (CMake 3.16+
and a C99 compiler; the HAL is pulled in automatically). The default
targets the PIC16F87XA family:

```sh
cmake -B build -S pic8-taskmgr
cmake --build build
./build/example_multi_blink
```

You should see the scheduler dispatch tasks tick by tick:

```
[t=  5] fast  #1
[t= 10] fast  #2
[t= 10] med   #1
[t= 20] fast  #4
[t= 20] med   #2
[t= 20] slow  #1
[t= 40] super  spawned blip
[t= 40] fast  #8
[t= 41] blip  #1
[t= 60] slow  #3
done: fast=12 med=6 slow=3 blips=1 (ticks=61, tasks=4)
```

Four blinks at distinct rates on RB0-RB3, plus a priority-0 supervisor that
spawns a one-shot blip at runtime at t=40. Point the same task manager at
the PIC18 family instead with `-DHAL_FAMILY=PIC18` (see
[pic8-taskmgr/README.md](pic8-taskmgr/README.md)).

### Real hardware

For a real PIC, use the MPLAB XC8 toolchain. There is one Makefile per
family:

```sh
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/microchip/xc8/v3.10/bin

# PIC16F87XA family:
cd pic8-taskmgr/mcu/pic16f87xa-taskmgr-mplabx
make MCU=16F877A        # also 873A / 874A / 876A

# PIC18F2455 family (needs the PIC18Fxxxx DFP installed):
cd ../pic18fxx5x-taskmgr-mplabx
make MCU=18F4550        # also 2455 / 2550 / 4455
```

This produces `build/<MCU>-multi-blink.hex`. Wire LEDs on RB0-RB3 and a
20 MHz crystal, then program with MPLAB X or any programmer. See the task
manager [README](pic8-taskmgr/README.md) for full wiring, and the HAL
[MANUAL](pic16f87xa-hal/MANUAL.md) for peripheral bring-up.

## Modules

Every module below ships its own `README.md` (what/why), most also have
`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/API.md`; the two HALs additionally have a
per-peripheral `MANUAL.md`. "Family-agnostic" means one implementation
builds unchanged against either family; where a module targets only one
family, that's called out.

## Documentation

- [pic8-common/MANUAL.md](pic8-common/MANUAL.md), family-agnostic
  conventions, the harness, the handle pattern, the shared interrupt
  model. Read this first.
- [pic16f87xa-hal/MANUAL.md](pic16f87xa-hal/MANUAL.md) /
  [pic18fxx5x-hal/MANUAL.md](pic18fxx5x-hal/MANUAL.md), per-peripheral
  register reference for each family.
- [docs/multi-family-plan.md](docs/multi-family-plan.md), the refactor
  that extracted `pic8-common/` and added the PIC18F2455 family behind a
  fixed contract (Phases 0-4 done, litmus test met).
- Datasheets are not vendored in this repo; reference Microchip's own
  hosted copies:
  [DS39582B](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/39582b.pdf)
  (PIC16F87XA),
  [DS39632E](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/39632e.pdf)
  (PIC18F2455 family).

## Requirements

- **Host simulation**: CMake >= 3.16 and any C99 compiler (gcc/clang).
- **Real target**: MPLAB X IDE v6.x and MPLAB XC8 v3.x (`xc8-cc`). Tested
  on a PIC16F877A and PIC18F4550; the examples use PORTB only, so they run
  on all parts of both families. The PIC18 build needs the PIC18Fxxxx
  Device Family Pack installed separately (the PIC16Fxxx DFP ships with
  XC8, see
  [pic18fxx5x-hal/mcu/pic18fxx5x-mplabx/README.md](pic18fxx5x-hal/mcu/pic18fxx5x-mplabx/README.md)).

## Development

`./scripts/bootstrap.sh` sets up a fresh clone: installs the host
toolchain the CMake builds need (`cmake`, `cppcheck`, ...) and a
pre-commit hook (trailing newline/whitespace, no-em-dash, `cppcheck` on
staged `.c` files). `--check-only` reports what's missing without
installing anything. See [scripts/README.md](scripts/README.md) for what
the hook checks and why `clang-format` isn't part of it yet.
