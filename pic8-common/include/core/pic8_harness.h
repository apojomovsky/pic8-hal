/**
 * @file    core/pic8_harness.h
 * @brief   Build-agnostic test/firmware harness, the one seam that lets the
 *          same example source build for the host simulator and a real XC8
 *          target with no `#ifdef` in the example code. Shared by every
 *          8-bit PIC family.
 *
 * @details
 *   Two execution models meet here:
 *
 *     - Host simulator: a normal program. Simulated time advances only
 *       when the family's sim step() is pumped, the test must terminate,
 *       and it reports pass/fail to stdout.
 *
 *     - Real target: firmware. Hardware time advances on its own, main()
 *       never returns, and there is no stdout.
 *
 *   The harness hides that difference behind four functions, each with a
 *   host implementation (the family's `pic8_harness_sim.c`, linked by the
 *   CMake build) and a target implementation (`pic8_harness_target.c` in
 *   this shared layer, linked by the XC8 Makefile). The build selects
 *   which file links; there is no `#ifdef` anywhere in the API or in
 *   example code that uses it. The target implementation is genuinely
 *   family-blind (four no-ops), so it lives here, not in any family tree;
 *   the host implementation is family-specific (it pumps that family's
 *   simulator) so each family provides its own.
 *
 *   Typical example shape (no `#ifdef` around code):
 *
 *       pic8_harness_init(SIM_CYCLES);
 *       // ... peripheral setup, identical on both builds ...
 *       for (uint32_t i = 0; pic8_harness_running(i); i++) {
 *           pic8_harness_tick();
 *           // ... work, same on both builds ...
 *       }
 *       pic8_harness_log("toggled %u\n", (unsigned)count);
 *       return pic8_harness_report(count >= 2);
 *
 *   On the target `harness_running` always returns 1, so the loop never
 *   exits and the log/report lines are unreachable. On the host the loop
 *   runs for `cycles` simulated cycles, then logs and returns the exit
 *   code.
 *
 *   Interrupt dispatch is also handled here: the host harness registers
 *   the family's @ref pic8_dispatch_all_irqs as the single sim IRQ
 *   callback, so examples never call the sim's set_irq_callback
 *   themselves. The real target gets the equivalent dispatch from its
 *   interrupt vector (the family's `pic*_isr_vector.c`). Each family
 *   implements `pic8_dispatch_all_irqs` with the same name (it fans out
 *   to that family's `HAL_*_IRQHandler` weak handlers), so the shared
 *   harness can name it without knowing which family it linked against.
