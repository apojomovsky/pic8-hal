/**
 * @file    pic8_usb_test_support.h
 * @brief   Host-stub-only driver hooks for exercising pic8_usb.h's public
 *          API contract without real USB hardware.
 *
 * @details
 *   Implemented only by pic8_usb_host_stub.c (never by the real-target
 *   pic8_usb.c) -- see "Host build story" in pic8-usb/docs/pic8-usb-plan.md
 *   for why there is no faithful host simulation of the real USB SIE, and
 *   why this header exists as a separate, test-only surface instead of
 *   growing pic8_usb.h itself. Only tests/example host tooling should
 *   include this; target firmware never does.
